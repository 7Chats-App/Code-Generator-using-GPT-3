# Code-Generator-using-GPT-3

About GPT-3 :

Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. It is the third-generation language prediction model in the GPT-n series created by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence research laboratory. GPT-3's full version has a capacity of 175 billion machine learning parameters. GPT-3, which was introduced in May 2020, and was in beta testing as of July 2020, is part of a trend in natural language processing systems of pre-trained language representations. Before the release of GPT-3, the largest language model was Microsoft's Turing NLG, introduced in February 2020, with a capacity of 17 billion parameters or less than a tenth of GPT-3s.

Description :

Since GPT-3 can be used for Classification, Generation, Translation, Transformation etc. The goal of the project is to use API for Code Generation/Completion . Example : Natural Language to Python code.

Requirements:
1) API key from the OpenAI API beta invite
2) Python 3
